# Increasing-the-DOF-in-Robot-Arm
This repository shows the modified Robot Arm assembly, that the DOF has been increased, and DOF refers to Degree of Freedom.

In this task, it has been increased the number of degree of freedom in the robot arm. The increasing or decreasing the number of degree 
of freedom is known by looking how many links and joints are there. In this task, the number of degree of freedom was increased to 6, 
it has been added an extra arm and joint, and to know the differences see the STL file for the assembly in the first repository uploaded
in the Github with name Robot-Arm-Assembly, it have the same mechanism of the robot arm assembly with different degree of freedom. In this 
repository, there are two STL file attached one for the new arm added and the other file is for the Robot Arm Assembly modified with the 
new arm. Also, the hieght of the robot was increased, and that's due to the new arm added to the mechanism.
